# Insight

The theme for UofTHacks 12 was "perspective". Insight was built to show users a different perspective and show them a way out of the echo chamber that many of us are stuck in online. Our opinions are shaped by one corner of the internet, and we often forget that there's a much bigger world out there. Insight lets users pick a topic, assigns them a perspective, lets them build an argument, and read the arguments of others as well. This lets them form diverse and nuanced perspectives.
