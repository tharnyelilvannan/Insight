# Insight

The theme for UofTHacks 12 was "perspective". Insight was built to show users a different perspective and show them a way out of the echo chamber that many of us are stuck in online. Our opinions are shaped by one corner of the internet, and we often forget that there's a much bigger world out there. Insight lets users pick a topic, randomly assigns them a perspective, and lets them build an argument using their own research. Users are encouraged to ensure they try their best when crafting their opinions. This lets them form diverse and nuanced perspectives.

This is a web application built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
